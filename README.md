# Airport Flask Backend Challenge

`💻` This was a challenge to build a simple API driven website using EJS and Flask. This api was built using flask with various tooling.

`🛠️` The tooling used in the project are as follows.
> 
1. `SQLAlchemy & SQlite` - Database ORM and Engine
2. `Flask n' Restful` - API framework and server
3. `flask-redoc` - API documentation using redoc and openapi spec file
